Microsoft stop supports on Windows Phone 8.1 since July 2017

Why is Windows Phone 8.1 (WP8) not a secure phone anymore?
- No more updates from microsoft to fix bugs since July 2017.
- There is no customizable permission grant to an app (Like, not letting to access camera)
- Best Advice to ensure security for all remaining WP8 users: Change your phone

These advices here are applicable mostly to windows phone 8 / 8.1 which is the most popular version of windows phone.
Basic measures to keep your windows phone safe:

- Install application only from the trusted app store (unfortunately it’s Windows Store)
- Always disconnect from wifi public (wifi that you get free from some random places) and turn it off when you don't need it
- Always check your data usage (it’s available in windows phone feature where you can set your data limit and to check data usage also)
- Put a pin that’s memorizable for you but not too esy (not 1234, your birthday) exmple of easy to remember but secure password: (your mother’s birthday year but change the front number ex: 1920 → 2920)
- If an app asks for some permissions (For example: Accessing Contacts, Photos, or Camera function, if you’re not sure it’s related to the app’s main purpose, you should avoid this app. If you still want, check reviews about this application in the internet as also the credibility of the developper
- Bluetooth should be turned off unless needed by going to Settings > Bluetooth
- If SD card use is enabled, users can sideload apps and upload data from the card but any apps installed from the SD card must             be signed by the Windows Phone Store or your organization’s certificate. o sideload an app from an SD card, the device must be unlocked, which you can prevent by setting the Disable development unlock (side loading) policy. By default, this development unlock is locked.
- You can explicitly stop any program from working in the back ground, hence the application will only use internet when *you* open it. You can block apps from working in the background by going to Settings->Application->Background Tasks
- Contacts, no control over this. But Microsoft before approving any app they check this and make sure only apps that uses contacts in the right way are approved


There are some people who still use this phone (Including one of the lecturer in TalTech who taught me last semester). The number is not big but this small percentage of population needs to keep getting supported when Microsoft itself doesn't anymore.

The reason why this article exists is to help individuals who still use Windows Phone because of their preference (like my Grandma apparently) who uses it because of a particular brand and only for basic phone functionality. There are also lacks of information about windows phone security in the internet due to their market share which is functionally doesn't exist anymore (0.24% source: http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide). Thus, it's important to bring a practical knowledge about to the end users who mostly don't have much knowledge about this OS but keep using it regardless of the fact that this phone wouldn't be secure anymore in the future.

Small number of unprotected and unsupported users of this "peculiar" device shouldn't be a reason why this article shouldn't exist to help them until they finally give up with the device.

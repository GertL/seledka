Microsoft stop supports on Windows Phone 8.1 since July 2017

Why is Windows Phone 8 (WP8) not a secure phone anymore?

- No more updates from microsoft to fix bugs since July 2017.
- There is no customizable permission grant to an app (Like, not letting to access camera)

Basic measures to keep your windows phone safe:

- Install application only from the trusted app store (unfortunately it’s Windows Store)
- Always disconnect from wifi public (wifi that you get free from some random places)
- Always check your data usage (it’s available in windows phone feature where you can set your data limit and to check data usage also)
- Put a pin that’s memorizable for you but not too esy (not 1234, your birthday) exmple of easy to remember but secure password: (your mother’s birthday year but change the front number ex: 1920 → 2920)
- If an app asks for some permissions (For example: Accessing Contacts, Photos, or Camera function, if you’re not sure it’s related to the app’s main purpose, you should avoid this app. If you still want, check reviews about this application in the internet as also the credibility of the developper

Should you worry about App permission? (App permission? LOL)

There is no app permissions control in Windows Phone 8 (WP8).

Anyway, You don't need it due to the unique design of the security in WP8. Why is that?

- You can explicitly stop any program from working in the back ground, hence the application will only use internet when *you* open it. You can block apps from working in the background by going to Settings->Application->Background Tasks
- Gallery (or Photos app) is only accessed when you ask the application to access it, either via a button inside the app or via the Photos app itself when you click share. Apps can not control the Photos or Videos. That's why an application like WhatsApp uses its own storage space.
- Contacts, no control over this. But Microsoft before approving any app they check this and make sure only apps that uses contacts in the right way are approved. I do not recall any report of misusing the contacts in WP8.

In general, do not compare WP8 to other OSs for mobile devices. WP8 was meant to be user friendly, the system and Microsoft are doing most of the security related issues for you.

Best Advice to ensure security for all remaining WP8 users: Change your phone

Sign you might have been hacked:

- Your phone bill increase extremely (Better to check your data usage frequently using app called “Data Sense” but it’s available in Nokia Lumia series only (Which most of windows phone are), there, you can set data limit and also check how much data you have used in a certain period of time
- If you see a suspicious download or transfer through bluetooth

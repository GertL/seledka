# Protective Measures
## Using Antiviruses
* It is one of the utmost tasks to set up an antivirus in order to protect your device from malware and dangerous creatures.
* There is a special tool called Virus Total which used on the web to scan malicious links, files, ip addresses, and file hashes using more than 70 anti-viruses, think of it as a software that uses other anti-viruses to scan all at once.
## Detecting Malicious Plugins
* Open a browser window and visit a known-good website, such as Google.com. Infected plugins often inject advertisements into the pages that display. If you see a lot of ads or strange text, you probably have an infected browser plugin. Ask a co-worker to pull up the same site on their computer and compare the appearance.
* Manually enter a few Web addresses to determine whether the browser opens the correct pages. Some malicious plugins will redirect you to unsafe websites or produce pop-up advertisements.
* Check your browser stability. If your browser keeps crashing or is performing unusually slowly, your system might be infected.
## Removing Malicious Plugins
* Install and update a standalone anti-malware scanner, such as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, Spybot Search & Destroy, or SUPERAntiSpyware. These scanners often pick up malicious items that a resident, real-time antivirus program might miss.
* Run your anti-malware scanner, remove any traces, and reboot
* Go to your browser Ad-ons/extensions section and find the plugin you are not familiar with and delete it
### Warning
* Download plugins only from trusted sites, such as Microsoft, Google, or Mozilla. Pay attention to the access rights required by a plugin before downloading it. If the access required seems unreasonable given the plugins function -- for example, a simple document viewer asking for advanced system access -- do not download it.
## Set up a browser: The secure way.
* The most common-sense part of this is to keep your browser software up-to-date.
* Manage and disable plugins that are deemed to be malicious.
* Always connect to websites using HTTPS.
* Clear browser history including cookies, as those are the most prime victim of a cyber attacker, they contain information about you that is confidential like your password.
* Stop saving your password, it is easily susceptible to being stolen.
## Set Up a Browser: Choices
* After talking about the security aspect of setting up a browser,
the browser of choice or more commonly known as "Browser Wars",
here's an overview:
* The most popular choices are usually:
- Google Chrome.
- FireFox.
- Safari (Mac OS Users).
- Opera.
- Internet Explorer (pls don't).
- Microsoft Edge (meh).
* The above mentioned choices are all browsers with considerable amount of marketshare, Google Chrome is the browser of choice for any user who wishes comfort in their experience as it is the absolute king of browsers in terms of the marketshare.
* Internet Explorer does not provide a very nice browsing experience ugly UI, not implementing some W3C standards, this results in websites looking frankly, horrifingly weird.
* For those seeking privacy (something Google Chrome doesn't care about), Firefox is the choice as it provides for an excellent experience.
* It's important to note however that, a large number of lesser known browsers tend to be based off of either Google Chrome or Firefox, the difference is the added features.
* For those who are absolutely stingy about privacy and security, Brave Browser is the choice.
## Set  Up an Email: Choices
* First, comes in the choice; the most popular choices are:
- Gmail
- Outlook
- Yahoo
- AOL
- Thunderbird
* The choice mainly lies within opinion, by large however, from a security perspective, using Thunderbird is better as it is less targeted by hackers (unlike Outlook, for example), but all in all, it is the choice of the person.
* On more Technical terms, Email Storage Capacity, size limit,Recipient limit, and email send limit are the choices for a niche community of people
* It is important to note however, that for the large majority, using any client provider mentioned above should provide a comfortable experience.
## Storing Passwords: The Secure Way
* Explore Password Managers.
* Enable MFA (Multi Factor Authentication).
## Firewall
* Keep it on!
* Only allow applications/processes that you know are legitimate!
* Set a rule to stop the browser from connecting to HTTP.
## Some Common Sense
* Use Passwords, Strong passwords.
* Don’t share your password.
* Don’t click on links you don’t trust.
* Don’t download things you don’t trust
* Always google about anything you’re doing/downloading.
* Log out off your accounts on websites.
* Use a password manager.
